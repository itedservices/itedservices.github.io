As I come to using Google apps more and more I find it very easy for my marking work flow. I set the task in Moodle.  
So in this case it was a quick lesson on one of the types of modern slavery. They were given these sites as a reference:  

*   [Amnesty](http://www.amnesty.org.uk/svaw)
*   [Crime reduction](http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/toolkits/tp00.htm)
*   [Anti Slavery](http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/antislavery/trafficking.htm)
*   [Ecpat](http://www.ecpat.org.uk)
*   [ilo](http://www.ilo.org)
*   [Fairtrade](http://www.fairtrade.net)
*   [Ethical Trade](http://www.ethicaltrade.org)

Then had to make sure these things were in it as a minimum.  

*   What the type of slavery is  
*   A map showing where it occurs  
*   Who is effected by it  
*   Images that evoke emotion  
*   A real example of it.  

And finally they had to share the presentation with me which since we are all in google apps they just start typing my name and it is there for them to click on.  

So the screenshot below shows the work arriving at the end of the day now all I need to do is look at it and I can give feedback and even edit it in place. The final step is for them to present this back to their classmates.  

Oh and I guess I should mention that the top message is from my History class with someone handing in their work late after school has finished for the day.
