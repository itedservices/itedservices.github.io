<a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2008/03/07/how-to-save-money-running-a-startup-17-really-good-tips/">This</a> set of seventeen tips comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis">Jason Calacanis</a>. Interesting to look at the list and see what we could apply. I like the lunch idea.<br/><blockquote>I've got a bunch of tips on how to do this for business. Among them:<br/><br/>Buy Macintosh computers, save money on an IT department<br/><br/>Buy second monitors for everyone, they will save at least 30 minutes a day, which is 100 hours a year... which is at least $2,000 a year.... which is $6,000 over three years. A second monitor cost $300-500 depending on which one you get. That means you're getting 10-20x return on your investment... and you've got a happy team member.<br/><br/>Buy everyone lunch four days a week and establish a no-meetings policy. Going out for food or ording in takes at least 20-60 minutes more than walking up to the buffet and eating. If you do meetings over lunch you also save that time. So, 30 minutes a day across say four days a week is two hours a week... which is 100 hours a year. You get the idea.<br/><br/>Buy cheap tables and expensive chairs. Tables are a complete rip off. We buy stainless steel restaurant tables that are $100 and $600 Areon chairs. Total cost per workstation? $700. Compare that to buying a $500-$1,500 cube/designer workstation. The chair is the only thing that matters... invest in it.<br/><br/>Don't buy a phone system. No one will use it. No one at <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/">Mahalo</a> has a desk phone except the admin folks. Everyone else is on IRC, chat, and their cell phone. Everyone has a cell phone, folks would rather get calls on it, and 99% of communication is NOT on the phone. Savings? At least $500 a year per person... 50 people over three years? $75-100k</blockquote><br/>Some of them are certainly not quite what I would want for my place of work but it's interesting to see inside the mind of a fast paced business model. Now bring on my 24 inch iMac.<!-- technorati tags begin --><br/><p style="font-size: 10px; text-align: right">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/mahalojasoncalacanis" rel="tag">mahalojasoncalacanis</a></p><br/><!-- technorati tags end -->
