**Office Mix**, now has an integration with Moodle that allows you to put your interactive Powerpoints directly into Moodle. This tool is designed to work with Powerpoint on Windows. This is ideal for flipped classroom lessons and adds to the already extensive Office 365 integration. For more on how to use Office mix you can view this [video](https://mix.office.com/) For this to be enabled in your moodle there are a few admin steps that have to followed. 

But if you are interested let us know and we can help getting this setup. One of the best features I have found is how easy it is to integrate images into quizzes for an average Moodle user. For more on the integration have a look at the [Microsoft blog](https://blogs.office.com/2015/01/26/office-mix-now-works-moodle-open-source-lms/).
