Now despite Kelvin telling me that I am not allowed to change things anymore I am a firm believer in innovate or die and if I don't continually play with Moodle it bores me and the kids so I figured why not have a bit of a play around with the Newbury College themes created by Shaun Daubney 
[moodle@newbury-college.ac.uk.](mailto:moodle@newbury-college.ac.uk) 

These themes are highly customisable and all I have done is changed the background colour, link highlights and some of the images and links. Now I guess I can get rid of some of the messy menus that have been cluttering the front page and get that stuff into the menubar. Incidentaly the menu bar comes from [lwis.net](http://www.lwis.net/free-css-drop-down-menu/) where you can find a free css drop down menu. In fact if Kelvin is still unhappy with the change I will use the [nvidia](http://www.lwis.net/free-css-drop-down-menu/dropdown.nvidia.com.no-flash.html) style menus on the old theme. 

The reasoning behind this change has for me come about from using Moodle more and more with my classes and observing the number of clicks that are required to get to certain things. If through this change we can make Moodle a better portal and the technology easier to use it has to be win win.
