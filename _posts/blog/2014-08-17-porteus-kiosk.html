<p>Recently have found that the Toshiba Netbooks NB200 and 500 have been getting very slow and need a solution to keep them going a little longer. Having tried to make one a Chromebook. See instructions <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5820358/how-to-turn-your-netbook-into-a-chromebook-with-chromium-os">here</a>. I decided that without the manangement etc there was little point. What they will be used for however is largely Moodle and Google apps so I figured that maybe a web kiosk solution would be a good idea. <a href="http://www.webconverger.com/">Webconverger</a> was my first idea. We use this for some library kiosks in school however I had a bit of work to do to configure with the wireless and proxy settings and wondered if there may be a faster way.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://porteus-kiosk.org/">Porteus Kiosk</a> is only a 38mb download and gives a nice easy to configure GUI for technicians to lock the machine down. I will post again when I see how it actually works in the school environment.</p>
