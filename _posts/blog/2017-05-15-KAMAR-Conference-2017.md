This week brings us to the KAMAR conference where we will be presenting [ADMS](https://ited.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/203268088-Active-Directory-Management-Service). This service syncs user data and groups from KAMAR to Active Directory. With a number of fields configurable this session will allow us to demonstrate both the install and basic setup of the service as well as answer any questions people may have about the tool.
