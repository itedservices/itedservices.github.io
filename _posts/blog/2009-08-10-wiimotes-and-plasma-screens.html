<img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2505/3807440464_c3f1069b84_m.jpg" alt="modified" width="240" height="180" />It may not be pretty but this is the modified TEK irpen that we have used for making a plasma screen interactive. The reasoning behind this came from having to put a wiimote in a year one classroom and the projector giving an image that kids would be too short for. So with a slight modification of the pen (we found that the glass on the plasma screen was too reflective in this case for an accurate reading) we were away. As you can see from the photo below the boys found it easy to use and were happily using the big computer monitor to write on ( they are playing <a href="http://www.echalk.co.uk">echalk</a>).<br/><br/>I guess I will have to add an update to this after a few field trials but we like the idea and with the price of Plasma screen so low at the moment it is a real option for class and hey there are no shadows. Just the thing to complement those Dell <a href="http://www1.ap.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-latitude-2100?c=nz&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;cs=nzbsd1">Latitude 2100</a> netbooks $1,046 NZD for a touch screen.
