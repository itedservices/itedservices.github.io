Now despite Kelvin telling me that I am not allowed to change things anymore I am a firm believer in innovate or die and if I don't continually play with Moodle it bores me and the kids so I figured why not have a bit of a play around with the Newbury College themes created by Shaun Daubney<br/><a href="mailto:moodle@newbury-college.ac.uk">moodle@newbury-college.ac.uk.</a><br/><br/>These themes are highly customisable and all I have done is changed the background colour, link highlights and some of the images and links. Now I guess I can get rid of some of the messy menus that have been cluttering the front page and get that stuff into the menubar. Incidentaly the menu bar comes from <a href="http://www.lwis.net/free-css-drop-down-menu/">lwis.net</a> where you can find a free css drop down menu. In fact if Kelvin is still unhappy with the change I will use the<a href="http://www.lwis.net/free-css-drop-down-menu/dropdown.nvidia.com.no-flash.html"> nvidia</a> style menus on the old theme.<br/><br/>The reasoning behind this change has for me come about from using<br/>Moodle more and more with my classes and observing the number of clicks that are required to get to certain things. If through this change we can make Moodle a better portal and the technology easier to use it has to be win win.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.digitool.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/20090806-prxsdaapautjxmpmgye8kb7gqd.preview.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1081" title="20090806-prxsdaapautjxmpmgye8kb7gqd.preview" src="http://www.digitool.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/20090806-prxsdaapautjxmpmgye8kb7gqd.preview-300x153.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="153" /></a>
