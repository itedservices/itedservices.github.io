### ITed Services
We believe in building relationships with our schools because if we have an understanding of what your vision is we can help to clarify, identify the challenges and the steps to take and refine it into something tangible.

ITed Services is a education IT solution company based in Tauranga. We are a talented and passionate team that is committed to helping your school get the best use out of your ICT.

We've been there before. Our team works in and with schools, so we understand the challenges and everyday problems that you are facing. ITed draws on this experience to rise to the challenge and reach a solution that suits management, staff and your learners.

Because we live and breathe what we do, we take an enormous amount of pride in our work. That means, if you aren't happy, we aren't happy and we won't rest until you are!

ITed Services has only one focus when it comes to your school. **The learners**.
